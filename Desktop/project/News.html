        The holidays aren't just for humans. Your four-legged family members want to get in on the fun! While you're rocking out to your favorite tunes, your dog might have their own requests, according to a recent survey.</p>

    Guide Dogs UK recently created a poll to help determine the best Christmas songs based on dog reactions.

<h2>Which Holiday Songs Do Dogs Like Best?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    Your dog might be obsessed with Christmas music without you even realizing it. Last year, the first-ever dog Christmas song came out, making people realize how much music can affect dogs. But as it turns out, a holiday song doesn't have to be made for dogs for them to enjoy it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    Based on a survey of 1,000 dog owners, here are the top 3 Christmas songs:</p>
<ol>
    <li>"Last Christmas" by Wham - 10% of votes</li>
    <li>"Jingle Bells" - 9% of votes</li>
    <li>"All I Want for Christmas is You" by Mariah Carey - 6% of votes</li>
    </ol>

    <p>According to the study, dogs reacted in an excited manner when hearing songs they liked. 23% of owners surveyed said their dogs wagged their tails when listening to their favorite song. 15% said their dogs were showing other excitable actions. Overall, most dogs preferred upbeat Christmas songs as opposed to slow, instrumental ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    Here are some other notable mentions from the survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Driving Home for Christmas" by Chris Rea</li>
<li>"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas" by Michael Bubl√©</li>
<li>";A Wonderful Christmas Time" by Paul McCartney</li>
</ul>
<h2>Do Dogs Like Listening to Music?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    Not only do dogs like listening to music during the holidays, but most enjoy tuning into the radio year-round. A study from 2017 concluded that dogs prefer soft rock and reggae above all other genres. But in general, listening to music can help dogs relax.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    This Christmas song survey revealed that a lot of people cater to their dogs' music tastes. 47% of dog parents said they play music that their dogs like at least once a week. About 30% of those surveyed said they prefer to leave music on for their dogs instead of the TV. Music is a great way to calm dogs during stressful times.</p>
<p><i>
    ';Houses are likely to be busier than normal and many dogs' routines will change. Music is often used to calm dogs in times of change and stress, so it is unsurprising that it will play a key role for dogs this Christmas,' said Dr. Helen Whiteside, chief scientific officer for Guide Dogs UK.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    So, next time you turn on a Christmas playlist, consider adding your dog' favorites to the mix. Maybe they agree with the songs from the survey, or perhaps they have unique musical tastes.</p>
