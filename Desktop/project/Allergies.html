        <h2>1. Give Your Dog a High Quality Fish Oil Daily</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, make sure you’re giving your dog a high quality fish oil. Fish oil contains omega-3, which is lacking in most commercial pet foods since it cannot survive the manufacturing process. Omega-3 helps soothe inflammation, and in some studies it significantly reduced itchiness in dogs with moderate to mild atopic dermatitis. We like Norwegian Salmon Oil for it’s ultra-high purity.</p>

        <p>Found in mother’s milk, bovine colostrum helps support a normal histamine response to help improve allergies. Colostrum contains immunoglobulins (often referred to as antibodies) which help boost the performance of your akita’s immune system. Canine colostrum supplements are a bit hard to find, but are included in some soft chew formulas.</p>
