    <h1>15 Dog Breeds You Think You Want But Probably Shouldn’t Get</h1>
    <p>There are hundreds of dog breeds in the world, each with their own unique look, purpose and personality. While many people think they want a certain breed, they sometimes find out that the dog they thought looked really cool is actually a lot of work to live with. This is why so many trainers and rescues try to advice first time owner to avoid certain breeds. Many breeds are becoming more popular on looks alone, but end up most often in the shelter when their novice owners can’t control them. Here are 12 breeds you think you might want but should probably avoid – unless you’re truly prepared.</p>
    
    <h2>#1 – Border Collie</h2>
    <img src="ask1.webp" height="400" class="center">
    <p>The Border Collie is growing in popularity in pet homes because of its popularity out in the working fields. They are intelligent dogs that need a job, so while they’re very good at cool tricks, they also need to be out herding, running agility courses or working on competitive obedience to be happy. They may be small, but their drive and intensity is a lot more dog than the average owner is expecting.</p>

    <h2>#2 – Belgian Malinois</h2>
    <img src="ask2.webp" height="400" class="center">
    <p>The Belgian Malinois is gaining popularity after the media noted it was the breed that helped bring down Osama Bin Laden. While it’s true that the Malinois is the most versatile police and military working dog, it’s also a dog that needs a job. The breed is bred almost exclusively for protection work and its drive, intensity and aggressive tendencies make it a very poor choice for a pet.</p>

    <h2>#3 – Dutch Shepherd</h2>
    <img src="ask3.webp" height="400" class="center">
    <p>The Dutch Shepherd is also a popular police and military working dog and shares many of the same traits as the Belgian Malinois. These dogs need jobs and will not only become destructive if left under-stimulated, but even somewhat aggressive and difficult to handle.</p>

    <h2>#4 – Patterdale Terrier</h2>
    <img src="ask4.jpg" height="400" class="center">
    <p>Patterdale Terriers are becoming more and more popular among the terrier hunting crowd and although they share some qualities of many other pet terriers, they’re much more intense dogs. Although small, they are bred almost exclusively for work and can become a major liability in the wrong hands.</p>

    <h2>#5 – Siberian Husky</h2>
    <img src="ask5.jpg" height="400" class="center">
    <p>The Siberian Husky is beautiful, but novice owners typically looking for a pretty dog to sit around all day find themselves way in over their heads with a Sibe. These dogs were bred for endurance running and without a lot of exercise and proper training, they are very difficult dogs to live with.</p>

    <h2>#6 – Australian Cattle Dog</h2>

    <p>The Australian Cattle Dog is a herding breed used for keeping cattle under control, which means they have very strong temperaments and are very confident dogs. The breed can be very difficult to handle for the novice owner and often end up in the shelter because the person received far more dog than they had intended.</p>

    <h2>#7 – Dalmatian</h2>
    <img src="ask7.jpg" height="400" class="center">
    <p>The Dalmatian is a working dog from Croatia, bred as a carriage dog. They are very strong, active and excitable dogs that need a lot of activity and training to remain mannered houseguests.

    <h2>#8 – Akita</h2>

Unfortunately, just how powerful and active these dogs are isn’t realized by the owner until it’s too late. Weimaraners need a substantial amount of exercise and training to keep them stimulated and easy to live with in the house and they are often too robust to be around children.</p>

    <h2>#10 – Airedale Terrier</h2>

    <img src="ask11.webp" height="400" class="center">
    <p>The Australian Shepherd is a very beautiful dog that can be seen participating in various dog sports.

    <h2>#12 – Schipperke</h2>
    <img src="ask12.webp" height="400" class="center">

They were originally used as hunting dogs and still maintain a lot of the prey drive necessary for the work. Because of this, they do not fare well around other small animals, dogs included. Jindos are very independent and are not the social butterflies many owners wish their dogs to be.</p>
