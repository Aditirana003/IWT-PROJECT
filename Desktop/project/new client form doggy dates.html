I further agree to provide the Company with proof of current required inoculations against distemper, kennel cough, parvo, lepto, bordetella, and rabies. I agree to stay current with inoculations and other medical treatment and preventative care and will notify the Company immediately if I learn or suspect the Dog has parasites or viruses and agree to cancel all scheduled Dates and not make further Dates until I receive clearance from the Company in conjunction with the Dog’s veterinarian.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I understand and acknowledge that my dog will be kept in the company of other dogs during the Date. I understand and acknowledge that even with current vaccinations, it is still possible for the Dog to become ill during or after the Date. I understand and acknowledge that by attending a Date there is a risk that the Dog may contract kennel cough, upper respiratory illness, diarrhea, nicks, cuts, scrapes, punctures, other viruses and/or bites during the Date, and that in the unlikely event the Dog is injured by another dog, that you will not hold the Company responsible for that injury.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I agree that if in my absence, the Dog should be injured, appear sick, or otherwise reasonably appears to require immediate veterinary attention as determined by the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, I hereby authorize the Company to consult with or utilize the services of any veterinarian selected by the Company.  I understand that I am responsible for any charges, including transportation costs, incurred with respect to any such veterinary services.  I name the Company as my attorney-in- fact to act in my name for the sole purpose of providing emergency medical care to the Dog.</li>
