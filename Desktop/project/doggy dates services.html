        <p>It’s a fact: dogs who spend time interacting, exercising, and playing with other dogs and people lead happy and healthy lives. Our Playgroup Program aims to develop your dog’s well-being and confidence by reinforcing calm, appropriate play behaviors in a safe environment. To do this, we transport your dogs to one of our (fenced-in) facilities (located on privately-owned farm land) where they engage in a supervised, controlled, and off-leash play session. Playgroup can also help improve your dog’s routine, prevent destructive behavior at home, prepare your dog for boarding or away-from-home situations, and, of course, alleviate dog-mom and dog-dad guilt.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At your dog’s initial evaluative play session, our Playgroup Supervisors will observe his/her play style, energy level, and personality to ensure he/she is placed in a group with the perfect pooch pals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our main objectives are to help your dog socialize, exercise, and, paws crossed, meet his/her BFFF (best furry friend forever)!</p>
